We can see that after the first 2 lines we set ECX and EDX to be zero,
(a xor a == 0 always).
now we check if DL (which are the 8 lower bits of EDX, so they are all zeros) is equal to the data in the memory unit at the addres of ESI.

We know that NULL-TERMINATOR at ASCII code is all zeros, which is just what we got at DL (after xoring).

Therefore, we can see that we check where is the NULL-TERNIMATOR from a given addres, which is ESI, which usually used as an source index pointer to a String or Char.

Now we can see that we increase ECX and ESI which mean that the code will search the NULL-TERMINATOR from the start index, ESI, and will stop when he finds him, moreover he will save the length of the String at to ECX.

In conclution we can clearly see that the code will find what is the 
String length from a given start index till the String ends.
