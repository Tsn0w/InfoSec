As start I wrote the shellcode.
Here I will explain little on the shellcode itself
beacuse the full documentation is at the shellcode.asm
as comment near to each line.
So first I opened socket with prototcol 0, type SOCK_STREAM
and family AF_INET beacuse under these constraint we can open socket as we want in this ex.

Then as said as at class I called dup2 for STDERR, STDOUT, SDTIN to out socket fd beacuse we want to let the server Commands and we will see the resuls.

Then I called connect inorder to connect to our server at the PORT 1337 as asked in the ex, with port 127.0.0.1 (because we open the server on localhost).

Then shellcode ran and open terminal for us as we wanted :D

Note:
- When I said I called <func_name> I mean that I called to her address at the plt table, done with help of IDA.
- The address we returned was the middle of the nope_slide +_ becuase the place we load the program can change, And I found it using IDA which is 0xbfff0e04 (where I jump). The len of the nop_slide is 942, which i found big enough.
